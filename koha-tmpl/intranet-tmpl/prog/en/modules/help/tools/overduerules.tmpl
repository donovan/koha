<h1 id="d940"><font size="5" id="i6i7">Overdue 'Notice/Status Triggers'<br /></font></h1>This tool lets you define triggers for overdue notices. You can send a borrower up to three notices and also tell Koha how many days should pass between the day a book was due and the sending of each of these notices. Koha lets you define a different notice schedule for each branch, and different schedules for each patron type you've defined within those branches. Finally you can set a notice to trigger a 'debar' on the borrower's account during any of the three triggers.<br /><br /><ul><li>Go to the 'Tools' module (usually under 'More' in your Global Nav)</li><li>Choose 'Overdue notice/status triggers'</li><li>'Select a library' to define an overdue schedule for</li><li><font style="color: #ff0000" id="y.iz" color="#cc0000"><span style="color: #000000; background-color: #ffe599">TIP: If you would like to define one overdue schedule for ALL branches at once, select 'Default'. This will apply the schedule you define to all the branches in your system</span></font></li></ul><ul><li>For each patron type (left most column), enter a number under the columns labeled 'Delay'. The number you enter represents DAYS. <br /><ul><li>Each number you enter indicates the days after an issue is due before an action is triggered.</li></ul></li><li>For each 'Delay' you choose a notice type (or 'letter') that will go to the borrower. <br /><ul><li><span style="background-color: #ffe599">TIP: You will need to set up your library's notices to populate this pull down</span><br /><ul><li><em>Get there:</em> More &gt; Tools &gt; Notices</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>When you are finished, click 'Save changes'</li></ul><font size="4" id="f8lt0"></font><h3 id="ubpq3"><font size="2" id="m_kg">Help! I've gotten an error message!</font></h3>If the numbers you've entered in a give row beneath the 'delay' columns are logically inconsistent, Koha will give you an alert, and explain the inconsistency.<br /><div id="aq5q" style="padding: 1em 0pt; text-align: left"><h3 id="l3li"><font size="2" id="ea:b">What happens if I leave the row for an patron type blank? (ie, no 'delays' have been defined)</font></h3>If you want Koha to trigger an action (send a letter or debar member), a delay value is required. No delays means no actions will be performed.<br /><h3 id="s7_5"><font size="2" id="ihjs">Where do I define overdue schedules? (ie, how many days pass before an item becomes 'overdue')</font></h3>When an item becomes overdue (ie, duration of checkout) is defined in Koha's 'Administration' module:<br /> <ul><li><em>Get there:</em> More &gt; Administration &gt; Circulation Rules (under 'Patrons and Circulation')</li></ul> <h3 id="l8xr"><font size="2" id="guz_">Where do I define fines? <br /></font></h3> <ul><li><em>Get there:</em> More &gt; Administration &gt; Fines Rules (under 'Patrons and Circulation')</li></ul>  <h3 id="wdmc"><font size="2" id="q6xk">What type of notice gets sent when a 'trigger' occurs in the 'Notice/Status Triggers' module? Email? Printed Notice?<br /></font></h3>Koha handles overdue notices in one of two automated ways: by email or by printed labels.<br /><br />If a borrower has an email defined in their patron account, overdue notices automatically get sent to the patron's email account according to the schedule defined in the 'Notice/Status Triggers' Tool.<br /><br /><span style="background-color: #ffe599">TIP: Patrons can alter their notification setting using the Messaging tool on their account.</span><br /><br />Borrowers that have no email defined will have their notices sent via email to the library for printing.&nbsp; The email is sent to the branch admin email, or failing that to the address set in the system preference as the 'KohaAdminEmailAddress'. This email is generated by the misc/cronjobs/overdue_notices.pl cron job.&nbsp; Contact your system administrator for help with this setting.<br /><br /><font id="fb.j" color="#ff0000">IMPORTANT: The email notice report that is compiled and sent to the admin (for borrowers with no email in Koha) rely on the 'delays' to determine when/how often that email gets sent as well. </font><br /></div><h3 id="kyt7"><font id="nw.r"><font size="2" id="kyt70">Where are notices defined?
