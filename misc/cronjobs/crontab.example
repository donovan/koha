# Koha Example Crontab File
# Author: Joe Atzberger <atz@liblime.com>
#
# This is an example of a crontab file for Debian.  It may not work 
# in other versions of crontab, like on Solaris 8, for example.
# 
# While similar in strcture, 
# this is NOT an example for cron (as root).  Cron takes an extra
# argument per line to designate the user to run as.  You could 
# reasonably extrapoloate the needed info from here though.
#
# WARNING: These jobs will do things like charge fines, send
# potentially VERY MANY emails to patrons and even debar offending
# users.  DO NOT RUN OR SCHEDULE these jobs without being sure you
# really intend to.  Make sure the relevant message templates are
# configured to your liking before scheduling messages to be sent.
#
# ENVIRONMENT:
# First, establish Koha's two important ENV variables.

PERL5LIB=/home/liblime/kohaclone
KOHA_CONF=/home/liblime/kohaclone/etc/koha-conf.xml

#
# MULTIPLE KOHA SUPPORT:
# You can still run jobs for this user's additional koha installs.
#
# For example, on the same codebase:
# */10 * * * *    KOHA_CONF=/home/liblime/koha-test/etc/koha-conf.xml /home/liblime/kohaclone/misc/migration_tools/rebuild_zebra.pl -b -z >/dev/null
#
# For example, on a separate codebase:
# */10 * * * *    KOHA_CONF=/home/liblime/koha-test/etc/koha-conf.xml PERL5LIB=/home/liblime/koha-test /home/liblime/koha-test/misc/migration_tools/rebuild_zebra.pl -b -z >/dev/null
# 
#
# SCHEDULED JOBS:
# Don't forget to keep the empty line at the bottom. 
# Cron/crontab will choke without it.
#
# m h  dom mon dow   command
